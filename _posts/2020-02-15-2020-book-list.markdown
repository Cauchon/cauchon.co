Recently I decided to take some time each day to read, starting with the classics. The goal will be about a book a month.

## Book List
1. Catch-22 - Joseph Heller
2. To Kill a Mockingbird - Harper Lee
3. A Brief History of Time - Stephen Hawking
4. 1984 - George Orwell
5. A Long Way Gone - Ishmael Beah
6. East of Eden - John Steinbeck
7. Fahrenheit 451 - Ray Bradbury
More to come...
