On a personal note, we moved to Portland last month and will be here for at least the next year.
#### Our Decision
San Francisco is has one of the highest cost of living in the country. When the pandemic emerged last year, it was unclear when we'd be returning to the offices. A year in, the assumption is that we won't be returning to our offices in a normal fashion for the remainder of 2021.

This provided us the opportunity to upgrade from a small one bedroom apartment to a house in another city. We have family in Portland and it is close to San Francisco, so naturally it was a good fit. 

Whether this is a short-term move or ends up being long term, Paige and I are very much looking forward to the future.
